# Find a string of characters using genetic algorithmes

Given a fixed string of characters (letters, numbers and special characters), the goal is to ÃÅfind this same string from a random string of the same length. 
A string generated by characters is considered as a chromosome or an individual.
The fitness function is the number of characters that differ between the fixed string and the managed string.
Thus, individuals with lower fitness values have more preference.
